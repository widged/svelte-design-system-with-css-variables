# Akar Icons (Svelte)
A perfectly rounded icon library made for designers, developers, and pretty much everyone.

---

## For Designers
Explore all icons at [akaricons.com](https://akaricons.com). Simply click the icon you'd like to use and paste it to your favorite application (Figma, Sketch, XD).

---

## For developers
Akar icons are currently available as individual React components. Start using it today.

### 1. Installation
Install with npm:

```shell
npm install --save akar-icons-svelte
```

### 2. Usage
Import the icons you need into your Svelte project and use them in components:

```html
<script>
  import { ArrowRight, Star, LinkOut } from 'akar-icons-svelte';
</script>

<main>
  <ArrowRight />
  <Star />
  <LinkOut />
</main>
```

Icons can be configured with inline props including inline ```style``` objects:

```html
<Star color="yellow" size={32} strokeWidth={3} />
```

You can also import the whole icon library:
```html
<script>
  import * as Icon from 'akar-icons-svelte';
</script>

<main>
  <Icon.ArrowRight />
</main>
```
